Small project regarding bike sales data.

In this project a dashboard was done in order to pull information about customers and understand who could be potential customers, actual customers and be able to grasp differences between age, salary, marital status, zone and education.

Here, I will explain step by step how the project was done:
  1. First of all, we discover that data is ambiguous having columns as "Marital status" and "Gender" with same information;    MALE AND MARRIED SHOWN AS M. After errors get fixed, we make sure to check and delete duplicated data or incomplete data.
  2. Once fixed, I decided to model the data in order to separate de age of the customers in 3 groups, Adolescent,Middle age     and Old, so we could clearly see who is involved the most in buying bikes.
  3. After that, we start building our pivot tables for the dashboard:
      1. We create the pivot table about the Avg Income Depending on purchase and gender
      2. We create the pivot table about the Costumer Commute distance (to verify if it affects buyers)
      3. We create the pivot table about the purchases based on age
  4. After that and finally, we create the dashboard to interact and do data-based conclusions for marketing campaings or internal decisions
